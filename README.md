# CodingAssignment
Changes since last Thursday:
* abandon Scanner, use string.split()
* convert from HashList to HashMap when reading input for duplicate detection by orgId/userId
* move buildtree() method to constructor on OrgCollection
* refactor OrgAttributes and UserAttributes so that attributes are private with public getter methods & move sets to the constructor.
* improve parser testing
